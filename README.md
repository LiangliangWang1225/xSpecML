# xSpecML
The xSpecML is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed for cross-species prediction of time-series transcriptomic data. This framework enables researchers to build robust classification models that can transfer knowledge between different species (e.g., rat to pig or vice versa) for predicting time-dependent biological states.
